## What's News?

[**[Libra is now Diem! New chiefs hired for launch in 2021!]**](https://www.diem.com/en-us/updates/diem-association/), Diem (formerly Libra Association) Press Release, December 1, 2020 -- _The Libra Association announces 
the adoption of a new name and the recruitment of key [chief] executives, reinforcing [with smoke and mirrors] its organizational independence [from Facebook]._

Q: Why the name change?

> A: "The original [Libra] name was tied to an early iteration of the project that received a difficult reception
> from regulators. We have dramatically changed that proposition [humbly starting with printing (private) Diem Dollars (≋USD) only on an invite-only (private) network.", 
> says [Stuart Levey, Chief of Diem (formerly Libra) Association](https://www.reuters.com/article/facebook-cryptocurrency-int-idUSKBN28B574)


[**Facebook's Libra may launch January 2021, with US dollars only - what this means**](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2020/11/27/facebook-libra-may-launch-january-2021-with-us-dollars-only-what-this-means/) - 
by David Gerard, November 2020 -- _There will only be a US dollar token running on the network — no EUR or GBP, no synthetic Libra currency;
Facebook's Novi (formerly Calibra) wallet is ready as a product, to be released in the US and some Latin American countries - "high-volume remittance corridors"; no date as yet, though Facebook hopes for January 2021_



## Diem (formerly Libra)

web: [`diem.com`](https://www.diem.com) (formerly ~~`libra.org`~~)

Q: Why is it called Libra? A: The Libra name was inspired by 
(1) Libra the [Roman unit of weight measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Roman_units_of_measurement), which was eventually used to mint coins. 
(2) Libra the astrological symbol is the balance of justice, and
(3) Libra phonetically sounds like libre, which is French for free or freedom.
The Libra name is a combination of money, justice, and freedom.

Q: Why is it called Diem? A: Diem stems from the famous latin phrase 'Carpe Diem' translating to
'Enjoy the present, make the most of today', a common mistranslation is 'Seize the Day' (according to [Carpe diem @ Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/carpe_diem)). 

> Carpe is the second-person singular present active imperative of carpō "pick or pluck" used by Horace 
> to mean "enjoy, seize, use, make use of". Diem is the accusative of dies "day". 
> A more literal translation of carpe diem would thus be "pluck the day as it is ripe" - that is, enjoy the moment. 
> It has been argued by various authors that this interpretation is closer to Horace's original meaning
>

## Historic - Libra Version 1.0 - Anno June 2019

The Official (Historic) Libra White Paper (V1.0), [PDF Download (~600k, 12 Pages)](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain-whitepapers/raw/master/libra.pdf) 

> Libra's mission is to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.
>
> This document outlines our plans for a new decentralized blockchain, a low-volatility cryptocurrency, 
> and a contract platform that together aim to create a new opportunity for responsible financial services innovation.

**Currency / Money**

> Libra's goal: A stable cryptocurrency built on a secure and stable open-source blockchain, 
> backed by a reserve of real assets, and governed by an independent association.
>
> (Source: Libra White Paper (V1.0))

Libra is a stable coin backed by a basket of (four?) currencies (USD, EURO, GBP, JPY), 
and US Treasury securities in an attempt to avoid volatility (and speculation). 
Facebook has announced that each of the (100?) partners will stake an initial US$10 million, so Libra is backed by US$1 billion of solid currency, on the day it opens.

(Source: [Libra (cryptocurrency) @ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(cryptocurrency)))


Q: What's a Microlibra? What's the smallest Libra subunit? 

A: Libra can be broken into 1 million smaller units, that is, 0.000001 Libra (six digits).
The official name for the smallest 0.000001 Libra unit is Microlibra. 


**Libra Rerseve**

- The Official (Historic) Libra Reserve White Paper (V1.0), [PDF Download (~40k, 4 Pages)](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain-whitepapers/raw/master/libra-reserve.pdf)

> Q: What are the actual assets that will be backing each Libra coin? A: The actual assets will be
> a collection of low-volatility assets, including bank deposits and government securities in currencies
> from stable and reputable central banks. As the value of Libra will be effectively linked to a basket
of fiat currencies, from the point of view of any specific currency, there will be fluctuations in the
value of Libra. The makeup of the reserve is designed to mitigate the likelihood and severity of these
fluctuations, particularly in the negative direction (i.e., even in economic crises). To that end, the
above basket has been structured with capital preservation and liquidity in mind. On the capital
preservation point, the association will only invest in debt from stable governments with low default
probability that are unlikely to experience high inflation. In addition, the reserve has been diversified
by selecting multiple governments, rather than just one, to further reduce the potential impact of such
events. In terms of liquidity, the association plans to rely on short-dated securities issued by these
governments, that are all traded in liquid markets that regularly accommodate daily trading volume
in the tens or even hundreds of billions. This allows the size of the reserve to be easily adjusted as
the number of Libra in circulation expands or contracts.


**Mint & Burn Libras**

> The Libra Association is the only party able to create
> (mint) and destroy (burn) Libra. Coins are only minted when authorized resellers have purchased those coins
> from the association with real assets to fully back the new coins. 
> Coins are only burned when the authorized
> resellers sell Libra coin to the association in exchange for the underlying assets. 
> Since authorized resellers will always be able to sell Libra coins to the reserve at a price equal to the value of the basket, 
> the Libra Reserve acts as a "buyer of last resort." 
>
> (Source: Libra White Paper (V1.0))


**Digital Identity (Id)**

_Open Identity (Id) Standard_

> An additional goal of the Libra association is to develop and promote an open identity standard.
> We believe that decentralized and portable digital identity is a prerequisite to financial inclusion and competition.
>
> (Source: Libra White Paper (V1.0))

Official Learn Diem Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and Answers:

> Q: What is the Diem payment system?
>
> The Diem payment system incorporates three aspects that work together to create a financial system: 
> 1) A secure, scalable, and reliable blockchain as the backbone of the payment system; 
> 2) Diem Coins that are backed by a reserve of assets made up of cash or cash equivalents and very short-term government securities; and 
> 3) Governance by the Diem Association and its subsidiary Diem Networks, tasked with developing and operating the payment system.
>
> Q: What are Diem Coins?
>
> Diem Coins are single-currency stablecoins (e.g., ≋USD, ≋EUR, and ≋GBP) 
> and a multi-currency coin (≋XDM) supported on the Diem payment system.
>
> Q: What is a Diem single-currency stablecoin?
>
> A: Diem single-currency stablecoin (e.g., ≋USD, ≋EUR, and ≋GBP) 
> is a (private) crypto currency that has a 1:1 face value to a (public) national currency (USD, EUR, and GBP)). 
> Diem single-currency stablecoins will be fully backed by the Diem Reserve, 
> consisting of cash or cash equivalents and very short-term government securities 
> denominated in the same national currency (USD, EUR, and GBP) as the stablecoins.
>
> Q: What is a Diem multi-currency coin (≋XDM)?
>
> A: ≋XDM is a (private) world crypto currency composed of the major single-currency stablecoins (e.g., ≋USD, ≋EUR, and ≋GBP)
> available on the Diem network for use in world-wide cross-border settlements or 
> as an alternative (private) currency replacing the unstable, high-inflation (public) national currency 
> leading to ("Diem-ization" instead of "Dollar-ization") 
> for people and businesses in almost all countries 
> that will never have a single-currency stablecoin on the Diem network.
>
> Q: How can I get Diem Coins?
>
> A: We expect most users will be able to buy Diem Coins through exchanges that list Diem Coins 
> or through the applications that will be built on the Diem Blockchain, 
> including digital wallets and other financial products and services.
>
> Q: How can I use Diem Coins?
>
> A: Diem Coin holders can use Diem Coins for everyday use to pay for goods and services 
> (if big if accepted by the seller), 
> send Diem Coins to other users, or cash out the Diem Coins back into the local (public) national currency.

## Blockchain / Protocol

- [The Official Diem (formerly Libra) Blockchain / Protocol White Paper](https://developers.diem.com/docs/technical-papers/the-diem-blockchain-paper/), [PDF Download (~400k, 29 Pages)](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain-whitepapers/raw/master/libra-blockchain.pdf) 

> **Abstract**: The Diem Blockchain is a decentralized, programmable database designed to support a
> low-volatility cryptocurrency that will have the ability to serve as an efficient medium of exchange for
> billions of people around the world. We present a proposal for the Diem protocol, which implements
> the Diem Blockchain and aims to create a financial infrastructure that can foster innovation, lower
> barriers to entry, and improve access to financial services. To validate the design of the Diem protocol,
> we have built an open-source prototype implementation - Diem Core - in anticipation of a global
> collaborative effort to advance this new ecosystem.
>
> The Diem protocol allows a set of replicas - referred to as validators - from different authorities
> to jointly maintain a database of programmable resources. These resources are owned by different
> user accounts authenticated by public key cryptography and adhere to custom rules specified by the
> developers of these resources. Validators process transactions and interact with each other to reach
> consensus on the state of the database. Transactions are based on predefined and, in future versions,
> user-defined contracts in a new programming language called Move.
>
> We use Move to define the core mechanisms of the blockchain, such as the currency and validator
> membership. These core mechanisms enable the creation of a unique governance mechanism that
> builds on the stability and reputation of existing institutions in the early days but transitions to a
> fully open system over time.



### Move Programming Language

_The (Secure) Contract-Oriented Programming Language for Digital (Blockchain) Resources / Assets_

[The Official Move: A Language With Programmable Resources White Paper](https://developers.diem.com/docs/technical-papers/move-paper/), [PDF Download (~200k, 26 Pages)](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain-whitepapers/raw/master/libra-move.pdf) 

> **Abstract:** We present Move, a safe and flexible programming language for the Diem Blockchain.
> Move is an executable bytecode language used to implement custom transactions and contracts.
> The key feature of Move is the ability to define custom resource types with semantics inspired by linear
> logic: a resource can never be copied or implicitly discarded, only moved between program storage
> locations. These safety guarantees are enforced statically by Move's type system. Despite these
> special protections, resources are ordinary program values - they can be stored in data structures,
> passed as arguments to procedures, and so on. First-class resources are a very general concept that
> programmers can use not only to implement safe digital assets but also to write correct business
> logic for wrapping assets and enforcing access control policies. The safety and expressivity of Move
> have enabled us to implement significant parts of the Diem protocol in Move, including Diem coin,
> transaction processing, and validator management.


Q: What's Move?
A: A statically-typed programming language derived from Rust, compiled to bytecode.

Update December 2020 - Official Move Documention Goes Live

> Welcome to Move, a next generation language for secure, sandboxed, and formally verified programming.
> Its first use case is for the Diem blockchain, where Move provides the foundation for its implementation.
> Move allows developers to write programs that flexibly manage and transfer assets, 
> while providing the security and protections against attacks on those assets.
> However, Move has been developed with use cases in mind outside a blockchain context as well.
>
> Move takes its cue from Rust by using resource types with move (hence the name)
> semantics as an explicit representation of digital assets, such as currency.
>
> [...]
>
> Move has all of the syntax and semantics you would expect from a first-class programming language. 
> However, there is an entire architecture dedicated to creating, using, and executing code based on Move.

**Examples**

[`p2p_payment.mvir`](contracts/snippets/p2p_payment.mvir) - Example of a peer-to-peer transaction script:

```
// Simple peer-peer payment example.

// Use LibraAccount module published on the blockchain at account address
// 0x0...0 (with 64 zeroes). 0x0 is shorthand that the intermediate representation (IR) pads out to
// 256 bits (64 digits) by adding leading zeroes.
import 0x0.LibraAccount;
import 0x0.LibraCoin;
main(payee: address, amount: u64) {
  // The bytecode (and consequently, the intermediate representation (IR)) has typed locals.  The scope of
  // each local is the entire procedure. All local variable declarations must
  // be at the beginning of the procedure. Declaration and initialization of
  // variables are separate operations, but the bytecode verifier will prevent
  // any attempt to use an uninitialized variable.
  let coin: R#LibraCoin.T;
  // The R# part of the type above is one of two *kind annotation* R# and V#
  // (shorthand for "Resource" and "unrestricted Value"). These annotations
  // must match the kind of the type declaration (e.g., does the LibraCoin
  // module declare `resource T` or `struct T`?).

  // Acquire a LibraCoin.T resource with value `amount` from the sender's
  // account.  This will fail if the sender's balance is less than `amount`.
  coin = LibraAccount.withdraw_from_sender(move(amount));
  // Move the LibraCoin.T resource into the account of `payee`. If there is no
  // account at the address `payee`, this step will fail
  LibraAccount.deposit(move(payee), move(coin));

  // Every procedure must end in a `return`. The IR compiler is very literal:
  // it directly translates the source it is given. It will not do fancy
  // things like inserting missing `return`s.
  return;
}

**HotStuff**

- [HotStuff: Three-chain Rules!](https://dahliamalkhi.wordpress.com/2018/10/24/hotstuff-three-chain-rules/) by Dahlia Malkhi, October 24, 2018 - Most protocols contain quadratic voting steps. When Byzantine consensus protocols were originally conceived, a typical target system size was n=4 or n=7, tolerating one or two faults. But scaling Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to n=2000 means that even on a good day, when communication is timely and a handful of failures occurs, quadratic steps require 4,000,000 messages. A cascade of failures might bring the communication complexity to whopping 8,000,000,000 (!) transmissions for a single consensus decision...
- [HotStuff: Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Consensus with Linearity and Responsiveness Whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069),  [PDF Download (~800k, 10 Pages)](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain-whitepapers/raw/master/hotstuff.pdf) by Maofan Yin, Dahlia Malkhi, Michael K. Reiter, Guy Golan Gueta, Ittai Abraham -  a leader-based Byzantine fault-tolerant replication protocol for the partially synchronous model. Once network communication becomes synchronous, HotStuff enables a correct leader to drive the protocol to consensus at the pace of actual (vs. maximum) network delay - a property called responsiveness - and with communication complexity that is linear in the number of replicas. To our knowledge, HotStuff is the first partially synchronous BFT replication protocol exhibiting these combined properties. Its simplicity enables it to be further pipelined and simplified into a practical, concise protocol for building large-scale replication services.

### Wallets 

**Official**

Historic 

**Calibra** (web: ~~`calibra.com`~~) - Facebook's official wallet for Libra. Calibra will be available in the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, integrated into Facebook's Messenger and WhatsApp. Calibra's launch is planned for the 2nd half of 2020. Calibra will be a custodial wallet - meaning they hold the actual Libra tokens - for the user (that's you!) - 
and will require KYC (Know Your Customer).

Rebranded in May 2020

[**Welcome to Novi (formerly Calibra)**](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-to-novi/) by David Marcus, Facebook, 
Head of Novi (formerly Head of Calibra), May 26, 2020 -- _With Novi, sending money will be as easy as sending a message. You'll be able to use Novi as a stand-alone app, as well as in Messenger and WhatsApp. There will be no hidden charges to add, send, receive or withdraw money and your transfers will arrive instantly. All Novi customers will be verified using government-issued ID, and fraud protections will be built in throughout the app._

Q: Why the name change?  A: "People were confusing Libra [the "pseudo-independent" payment network - "blockchain"] 
and Calibra [the official Facebook Libra wallet] all the time", says David Marcus.

**Novi** (web: [`novi.com`](https://www.novi.com), twitter: [`@novi`](https://twitter.com/novi)) - Facebook's official wallet for Libra from Facebook Financial (F2) that also
incl. Facebook Pay, WhatsApp Pay, among all things payments.

Regulation, Regulation, Regulation

There's a [bipartisan bill in US Congress](https://sylviagarcia.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-sylvia-garcia-and-rep-lance-gooden-introduce-managed-stablecoins-are) to firmly rule that managed stablecoins - they mean Libra - are securities. 
Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) and Lance Gooden (R-TX) are pretty sure that Libra-like tokens would be securities already - it was 
immediately obvious that this would constitute an exchange-traded fund or synthetic foreign-exchange derivative - but 
they want to nail it down. Whether this bill has legs depends ...

Skeptic / Critical Thinking

- [Facebook Libra is Architecturally Unsound](http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/libra.html) by Stephen Diehl, November 2019 - Libra's byzantine tolerance on a permissioned network is an incoherent design; Libra has no transaction privacy; Libra HotStuff BFT is not capable of achieving the throughput necessary for a payment rail; Libra's Move language is not sound; Libra's cryptography engineering is unsound; Libra has no capacity for consumer protection mechanisms.

Time and again, Facebook's leaders, faced with a choice between money and honouring their promises, 
have grabbed the money. And nothing could be more about money than creating a new currency. 
Only a fool would trust Facebook with his or her financial wellbeing. 
But maybe that's the point: with so much personal data on some 2.4bn monthly active users, 
who knows better than Facebook just how many suckers are born every minute?
